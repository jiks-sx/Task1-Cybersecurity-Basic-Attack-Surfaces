# Objective
The task is designed to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts by exploring the CIA triad, attacker types, attack surfaces, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. The outcome is not just theoretical knowledge but practical awareness of how everyday applications and systems can be exploited, and how to think like both a defender and an attacker.
